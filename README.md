This repo is used to submit my Udacity Nanodegree projects. I really enjoy hacking these projects, pushing myself to think harder in difficult problems and gaining valuable, timely feedback from reviewers.

There are two types of folders in the root directory:

1. lower-case spelling. These are projects currently under review. 
2. capital-letter acronyms. These store projects that meet specifications.
