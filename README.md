This repo is used to submit my Udacity Nanodegree projects. I really enjoy hacking these projects, pushing myself to think harder in difficult problems and gaining valuable, timely feedback from reviewers.

There are two types of folders in the root directory:

1. lower-case spelling. These are projects **currently under review**. 
2. ending with ND. These store projects that **meet specifications** or will not be reviewed anymore.
